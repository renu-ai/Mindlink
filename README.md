# MindlinkAI Cognitive Training Chatbot

MindlinkAI is a cognitive training chatbot designed to assist users in enhancing their cognitive abilities through interactive tasks. This project evaluates the chatbot's performance against baseline models and conducts experiments to measure its effectiveness.

## Project Structure
1. initial_testing_code.py
This file contains the initial testing code used to run experiments for evaluating the chatbot's performance. It sets up the testing environment and provides early-stage insights into the model's behavior.

2. Backend and Frontend
The backend and frontend components, developed by Renu, form the core framework for user interactions with the chatbot. The backend manages model processing and handles user data, while the frontend ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience.

3. Testing Baselines
The testing baselines are used to compare MindlinkAI's performance against the GPT model. These tests help measure key metrics such as task completion, user satisfaction, and response quality. Plots generated from these tests are included in the paper to illustrate the comparison between MindlinkAI and GPT.


We ran our code through the automatic paper reviewer just for fun and here are the comments we received. The entire paper was too large to fit so we used the first 8 pages. 

Our results were: 

4 Reject :-( 

    
The experimental design has several flaws, including the use of synthetic data and the lack of real-world testing, which limits the validity of the results.



The evaluation metrics are not well-defined, and the sample size for user feedback is too small to draw significant conclusions.


The clarity of the methodology, especially regarding the implementation details of the adaptive algorithms and the multimodal integration, is lacking.

There is insufficient discussion on the limitations and potential negative societal impacts of the proposed framework.
